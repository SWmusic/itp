# The Imagining! (Midterm: Phase 1)

## What I did

I dreweds a picture. And I dreweds it good. It's an elden ring, the symbol of power from the game of the same name. It's four circles arranged in a Celtic pattern with a line going straight down the middle and ending at the intersection of the bottom-most two of the four circles. The line extends up past the top circle, ending in a Y shaped split, where the angle of the line of each direction is roughly 45 degree angle in both the positive and negative x direction.

## BUT HOW???

Using my brain, I activated the neurons in my arm (my right arm specifically), all the way down to the muscles in the forearm and hand (along with the metacarpals and phalanges), which resulted in my hand taking the pen that was immediately near me, and constructing circles using points and radii. Then I dreweds a line. Then I dreweds 2 more lines makin' that Y shape everyone's yammerin' about these days.

## Wasn't it difficult?

No, not really. At first however I did draw the circles at the wrong starting points! The intersection of the bottom two circles was only tangientally meeting at a point, rather than making an ellipse-shaped cross-section. By moving the center points inwards to the center ring respectively, it fixed my problem and formed the elden ring, foul tarnished.

## What code wasn't yours?

Well the story of Elden Ring is made by George R. R. Martin, although I don't know who made the elden ring's design. That being said, I did use an online picture as reference to draw it by hand.
