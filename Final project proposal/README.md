# Sam's final project proposal

So, I want to make games at some point, that is why I am taking this class, since it is a prerequisite to game design. Therefore, I think I will make games for the final project as a test to myself. Specifically I will make 2 different games. The 2 games I am going to make are: tic tac toe, and a text adventure game (optional, as tic tac toe may take up too much of my time if I am overestimating myself, also in similar fashion to a game like Zork) which I have not decided a story for yet. I am thinking the names of each respectively will be Tic Tac Toe, and Horror Text Adventure Game (name work in progress).

## Quick summary

Tic Tac Toe will be just that, tic tac toe. The text adventure will be a game where you can input options to "move" around in the world I will describe solely from words, until you either make bad decisions or you go down a good path and win the game.

## 3 resources

For tic tac toe I will use this guide: https://realpython.com/tic-tac-toe-ai-python/ . This guide walks you through how to do it with an ai player, and this guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3G1ZgOMFxo I believe teaches you how to do it with two players.

For the text adventure, I am going to use https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/coursepages/intro-programming/README.md this free online computer science course from Harvard to further flesh out my fundamentals.

For both of them I will use this https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/ guide on game programming in python.

## What are my projects? (more in depth)

For tic tac toe it will be a simple game where there is a 3 x 3 grid, and the player can place either Xs or Os down to make a straight line either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, at which point the player will win. I'd like their to be a choice asking the user if they'd like to play against another person (who will be in the room with you, taking turns using the same computer), or versus an AI. You will not be able to beat the AI. It would be even better if I could figure out a menu screen as well.

For the text adventure it will be simple. There won't be any visuals, but every environment and option will be described to you. Players will be able to choose their option, and the game will "proceed" with an event, either minor or major based off of the gravity of the choice in the current context. This could be as simple as picking up a key, to as complex as say "running away" from a monster.

## What would I like to get done, etc?

A good outcome will be having tic tac toe completed and at the very least support 2 player compatibility.

A better outcome would be having tic tac toe completed, with both 2 player and vs AI compatibility, and a way to choose between the two when the program first runs. In this case, I believe I can do that as well as have a basic text adventure completed.

The best outcome would be a completely fleshed out tic tac toe game as previously described, and an at length text adventure. It would also be awesome if I can figure out a way to "attach" items to the player character, this way I can have players "hold" a key without needing to create new ones every time I want to use it. This however is going to require game logic, which I am not familiar with, hence why I am making the text adventure optional as it could take me a long time to make good.

## Calendar

I'm sorry, but I'm awful at scheduling things ahead of time, I will try my best. For skills, learning how to program game logic, as well as how to make visual objects that respond to user input (for tic tac toe) will be a requirement here.

By April 16th I will have watched at least one of the videos on making the tic tac toe game, and I will begin a draft on the story for the text adventure. File for tic tac toe created, and began being coded. More videos from the Harvard course will have been studied (I'm already on the 3rd lecture).

By April 23rd, both videos for the tic tac toe game will have been watched, as well as the article on game programming been read. At this point the final draft for the story of the game will be completed, and work on that will begin. Hopefully by this point, the tic tac toe game will have a few features. Further Harvard study will be completed, hopefully more than halfway at this point, if not more.

By April 30th I would like to have tic tac toe almost ready if not completely finished by this time. Depending on where it is made, further features not described earlier in the proposal may be added if time allows due to other class interference. Text adventure game will be far along at this point. Harvard videos are near finished.

May 7th, both games are ready to be turned in. Hopefully, I will have finished the Harvard videos as well by this point. The Harvard mentions are more a personal goal than they are this project, but they are extra programming knowledge that I will most definitely use here, hence why I mentioned them and set deadlines for myself with them.
