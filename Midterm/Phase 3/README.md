# I did a thing: Part 2

## What thing was it?

Compounding on my code for phase 2, I made a function drawObject(x, y, s), that uses the translate() function to accept inputs for x and y then using those inputs to move the drawing the around the grid. Then I added the scale() function to accept inputs for s, and modify the size of the drawing. Also, I added the push() and pop() functions, so that the drawing wouldn't interfere with itself when called multiple times.

## How?

Using my eyes, I followed the guide on the class repository. Then using my fingers, I made the new function with the arguments x, y, and s, then added the translate, scale, push, and pop functions within the function. After that, I added the draw() to call the drawObject function multiple times in different places.

## What was hard, and how did I make it easy?

Well, at first I was unsure of adding the parameters. I actually added them in the first time correctly without realizing it, because my code wasn't running (duh, I wasn't calling the function I had just made!), so I tried defining draw within the function drawObject. At this point I hadn't read through the entirety of the instructions for phase 3 so that's why a lot of the errors that I made that made me struggle with this section of the project were made. Had I just read through all questions would've been answered lol. But anyways.

After actually reading all the way through, then all became clear. I used the given code as a guide to add my own things, once done, I messed around with sending my drawing to different places on the screen to check that it worked, then saved and exited.

## Where did I get my code?

From the class repository on the midterm: phase 3 section.
