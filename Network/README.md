## Problems faced

Things were going well till we wanted to add .css stuff. We were looking around w3schools.com for how to format it and such and it worked! We have it formatted to be in the middle, and we changed fonts. The only thing that we are aware of that doesn't work is the favicon or the websites' icon.

## What I did

I did a lot of the creative direction, finding of the source code of other websites and kept us organized. I found documentation of some of the syntax such as the div, p, header, h, and br, and figuring out the uses for each. I cropped the picture imbedded for favicon, but we won't see it unfortunately :(. I also provided one of the images, both youtube videos as well as the embedded code for the youtube video. I wrote my own bio, and I made the really annoying sound as well. I sent Miles the code for the audio controller.

## What everyone else did

Miles - Miles did all the typing, plus the hosting, and figured out how to format some of the css stuff with a tiny bit of help me from me on that. I think he did well and helped us keep a solid workflow to get it done really quick. He was good at collaborating for creative ideas with me. The website would not look nearly as good if he did not contribute to the project.

Timmy - He just wrote the bios and made some stuff up for them that were funny, but I wanted to write my own. I can't think of any other help he provided, no hard feelings.
