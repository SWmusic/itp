# **THE READING OF THE PYTHON**
###### ~~Sam Edition?~~

## *Chapter 1*
### What I knew:

I already knew that debugging was the process of finding errors and fixing them!

### What I didn't know:

I didn't know that ('the text here') is considered a string by the computer. I didn't know what a string was until I read this text.

## *Chapter 3*
### What I knew:

I'm gonna be honest, this was all new stuff to me! It was awesome!

### What I didn't know:

One thing I didn't know was the define command, but it seems incredibly useful going forward because of the way you can turn a string of actions into your own command for the computer to perform!

## *Chapter 5*
### what I knew:

The one thing I knew about in this chapter was that programs (in this case, Python) will send out an error message after enough repetitions of a command. I didn't know it was called infinite recursion that caused this however, and I didn't know that 1000 was the limit!

### *The new stuff*

Learning about the if, else if, and, or statements seemed very useful, although I don't have a complete grasp on when to use some of them yet I am confident in the future that I will!

## *Chapter 10*

### Hey I knew that!

Gather round and hear my tale:
I didn't know anything this time. We've gone far enough into the book that I can't even pick out a single thing that I recognize!

### Hoo boy, what was that?

Pretty much this entire chapter is new information to me, but I have to pick out one thing so, deleting elements, I choose you!
Deleting elements is a very useful ability. So far we've been taught more how to make and less how to take away, and so I've been wondering about how one would go about clearing, deleting, getting rid of, etc etc, and lo and behold I read through a section that teaches me how to do so!
